# My Processing Stuff

##  Description:
This is just a few files I had created during my first coding adventure.  The original source is [The Coding Train](https://www.youtube.com/@TheCodingTrain) on Youtube's platform.  I have found this man 'Dan' very helpful.  Many project folders exist within this directory.  They're mainly just the basic code written out for understanding.  The movingpumpkin project is the one I personally created using the fundamentals from the other project folders.  Decided randomly to put them on github just so they'll exist should my computer go boom boom.
